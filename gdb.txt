Exercise 4 â€“ GDB

1. 
The first thing I would do is compile the program using gcc with -g added. I then call the executable file with gdb. I set a breakpoint at the function generateAttendance with "break". Then I "run" the program. 

2.
After running the program, it will stop at the breakpoint position (before the function). I "step" in the function and call "next" until I arrive to the first node of the linked list. I just now "print" the address pointed at that variable by adding "&" before the variable.


Here are the commands from questions 1 and 2 together:

$ gcc -g -o <executableOfFile> <fileToDebug>
$ gdb <exectuableOfFile>
(gdb) break generateAttendance
(gdb) run
(gdb) step
(gdb) next
(gdb) print &<variable>
(gdb) quit
